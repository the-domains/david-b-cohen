Wedding hours before Hurricane Katrina, as Yemeni cab drivers drive by, shouting, "Mazal Tov!"

After twenty five years as a rabbi, David Cohen of Congregation Sinai, Milwaukee, WI, thought he had seen it all. Until this past August, when Jessica Ketten, daughter of board president, Judi Ketten, was slated to wed her fianc√©, David Levi, Saturday night in Manhattan.

Then Hurricane Irene joined the guest list. Evacuations were ordered, including the wedding venue; New York City prepared to shut down. As Rabbi Cohen flew in Friday afternoon, a new plan was born: Upon landing, Rabbi Cohen went straight to the restaurant where the rehearsal dinner was about to commence. As he emerged from a cab, sixty guests in black tie gathered around a rising Huppah, and, within seconds, there on the bustling sidewalk, a wedding was underway. Water dripped from air conditioners onto the Huppah. Pakistani cab drivers rolled down their windows to say "Mazal Tov!" A more "freilich" (joyous) event the streets of SoHo haven't seen, before or since.  
Afterwards, Rabbi Cohen reflected on the affair. "I was impressed that the couple and families kept everything in perspective. Rather than cancel and reschedule, as did more than two thousand couples that weekend, they embraced the new reality. They decided that having friends and loved ones together was more important and precious than a particular venue. I often joke with couples that if they can make it through the wedding the marriage should be a snap; with David and Jessica, it is the absolute truth."
