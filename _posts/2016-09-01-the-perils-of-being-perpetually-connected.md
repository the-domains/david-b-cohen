**The Perils of Being Perpetually Connected - A Sermon by Rabbi David B. Cohen**

Two lifelong buddies have traveled together, apart from their wives, every year for more than half a century of increasingly exotic outings. For their latest adventure, they decide on an ice-fishing trip to the Upper Peninsula. Late one very cold winter night, the two men tromp out onto the ice, loaded with gear. Just as they start to cut a hole for fishing, a voice booms out in the dark, "Don't cut the ice!" Startled, one guy says to the other, "We've had too much to drink." As they bend over to resume, the voice commands a second time, "Don't cut the ice!" Once again they decide their imaginations are playing tricks on them. So they take up the saw, but for the third time the voice thunders, "Don't cut the ice!" At that, one of the men peers up into the darkness and asks, "Is that you, God?" "No," comes the reply, "It's the rink manager."

Personally, I prefer to spend my time in Northern climes during the summer. My location of choice is Mount Desert Island, Maine, home of Bar Harbor and Acadia National Park. It's a pristine setting, rocks meeting the sea, inland lakes surrounded by tall fir trees and mountains sculpted during the last ice age.

What Mount Desert Island doesn't have is decent cell phone coverage or broadband Internet access. Well, that's not entirely true; there's WIFI at the public library, but it's not close by. For us, going to Maine is a time to spend time differently, to read books, ride bicycles, play cards, go hiking, in short, to explore and experience.

I don't want to over romanticize -- we do, in fact, recreate some of the chaos of our lives here -- our kids are overprogrammed and require lots of driving around; we're constantly make plans with family and friends; but still, we try to live life without the electronic screen. In a sense it's a lot of what we don't get here. Here we have no time to ourselves, no time to think, to contemplate, to regroup. There we do.

The promise of technology was that it would save us time by automating routine tasks, like paying bills. It would keep us better connected with friends and loved ones. And it has done those things -- just ask any grandparent who Skypes with grandchildren across the country. Without recent advances in technology our lives would be impoverished in many ways.

Yet, as technology kept its promise to keep us connected to each other, to our workplaces, to libraries, data banks, e-commerce, there were some unanticipated costs. The problem of technology is summed up in a television ad with Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Gates. Jerry says, "Bill, you've connected over a billion people. What's next?" The screen goes black and two words stand out in brilliant white: "Perpetually Connected." Being perpetually connected must have sounded like a good idea, at least in some ad agency, but we have come to learn being perpetually connected comes with some very real human costs.

We've learned that to be perpetually connected is to be perpetually distracted:

An opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal decries the loss of productivity as workers are distracted on average every three minutes by texts and email. With no small irony, this article appears on the web site flanked by an advertisement for the Journal's newest electronic feature: STAY CONNECTED 24/7VIA EMAIL NEWSLETTERS AND ALERTS...

How many text messages do you think teenagers send a month? Those of you who made the mistake of not getting unlimited texting plans can probably answer. Teenagers now send an average of 2272 texts a month, twice the amount they sent last year.

It's hard for parents to convince their children to stay away from the screen when we ourselves can't go 20 minutes without checking our smart phones.

Author Stephen King said it was when he realized he was spending "almost half of each day's consciousness" facing screens that he decided to cut back. He said: "I don't think any man or woman on his or her death bed ever wished he or she had spent more time sending instant messages."

And what about the content of those instant messages? Television writer and producer Bill Persky wrote an Op-Ed piece entitled "We're Killing Communication" in which he complained that the new technology had brought him friends he didn't need and updates about their lives be didn't want, such as, "eating leftover lasagna" and "getting a colonoscopy."

Perpetually connected. Does this describe you? Do you need to have the cell phone at arms reach? Do you automatically check email every five minutes? Do you respond to email, even when you are on vacation, even when the recipient has already gotten a message saying you are on vacation and cant return the call? When you're on vacation, is hotel WIFI access a deal breaker?

You, my friend, are perpetually connected. Forget about wasting time -- after all faddish pursuits have always been with us -- but consider the glut of information you receive that you don't need or want. Think about it: Fifteen years ago, did anyone use the phrase, "TMI", too much information?

Don't get me wrong. I am no luddite; I love technology, I am what they call an early adopter, acquiring the latest gadgets and refusing to read to manual. Yet, in the embrace of technology, I recognize a very real dilemma. What we have gained in broad-band's breadth, we have lost in human depth. Our connected lives ensnare us so completely that we rarely have time to think, to contemplate, to reflect. We are losing depth in thought and feeling and relationships. And there's the irony: we may be perpetually connected to the crowd, but the closer we get to the crowd, the further we recede from those closest to us, the more we lose touch with our own souls.

In short, being perpetually connected means our public life with the crowd overshadows our interior, private lives. We may have hundreds of facebook friends, but not many know us well.

We are not the first generation to deal with this crisis. Over the past few thousand years, periods of rapid technological change have upset the balance between people's public social lives and their private, interior lives. What's more, in every generation, seminal figures arose to provide strategies for reasserting the balance between public and private lives.

In his book, "Hamlet's Blackberry", William Powers describes the way influential thinkers negotiated periods of rapid technological change. I want to share some of their stories with you today, that we might glean from both western historical models, as well as Jewish models, a way to balance our public and our private lives.

Powers begins with the assumption that by virtue of our being perpetually connected, we are always in the midst of a crowd. From a Jewish perspective, being in the crowd has its advantages; after all, it is through relationships that we affect change in the world, and even come to know God.

But when does the crowd become too big? For Plato, twenty five hundred years ago, the growth of Athens as an urban center was a boon to philosophers who enjoyed the rhetorical give and take. Yet, he found that the crowd was oppressive, robbing him of time to think and reflect. He increasingly sought to be outside of the city, eventually establishing his academy in the country. Imposing distance allowed Plato to make the most of life in an increasingly, crowded, busy society. It allowed him to fulfill his teacher Socrates' goal: Give me beauty in my inner soul; and may the outward and inward man be at one."

Plato's dilemma remains with us today in our perpetual connectedness; no matter where we go, if there's a cell phone in our pocket, the crowd is always with us. A Jewish teacher suggests a way to escape. Rabbi Nachman of Bratzlav was a practioner of hitbodedut, of wandering outside in the country, thinking, meditating, reflecting, deliberating. Like the Biblical Isaac, who conversed with God in his late afternoon walks in the fields, Nachman found a different kind of connectedness, not with his fellow man, but with the heart of the Universe.

Five hundred years after Plato, the poet and Roman statesman Seneca encountered a different imbalance between the public and private spheres. Leaving the city, as Plato had, didn't solve Seneca's problem. As Seneca himself put it: "The man who spends his time choosing one resort after another in a hunt for peace and quiet, will in every place he visits find something to prevent him from relaxing." The solution for Seneca was to narrow his focus from the crowd to the individual. He accomplished this most often through writing letters. Seneca found the writing of a letter as a place to have a private, reflective, moment. Through this he found "inner distance" a way to remove himself from his surroundings, to have an audience of one.

In his own way, Seneca was creating the conditions for what Martin Buber, two thousand years later, would call an "I-Thou" relationship. Rather than relating to those around us as instruments to fulfill our own needs, Buber suggested that beyond such utilitarian relationships are truer, more authentic, relationships that obtain when two souls connect, through the medium of God. Like Buber, Seneca aimed to reclaim a quality of presence in the world. And he wanted to do it through relationships with others.

Fifteen hundred years later, Gutenberg ushered in a period of transformative technological change, the creation of the printing press. We most often think of his invention as the beginning of an information revolution, the widespread dissemination of information that had heretofore been held by a chosen few. Yet, the printing press was an essential technology of inwardness. Before its invention, reading was a public activity. People didn't read to themselves. Instead, public readings were the norm. Now, however, people could have a personal relationship with a text Reading became an immersive experience. As Poet Willliam Stafford put it: "Closing the book, I find I have left my head inside."

Our era of perpetual connectedness has made reading a complicated business. It began with the hyperlinking of text, when certain words in electronic documents appear in the color blue, indicating that if you click on that work, you'll be instantly transported elsewhere to learn more in depth about that topic. As a research tool, hyperlinks are a Godsend, making quick work of what used to take hours of research. But it also makes reading a less linear experience. Endless diversions appear in the text. What's more, the recent batch of e-readers, like the Kindle or the Ipad increasingly are bundled with software that enables users to surf the web during the course of reading, toggling between sports, weather, news, email, and oh yes, the book they were reading. Why is this a problem? There's a difference between access to information and the experience of it. Technology that encourages multitasking while reading encourages access to the detriment of experience.

For Jews, reading Torah is the way we commune with God, learn from our people's experience, and access their wisdom. the concept of hyperlinking text derives directly from the rabbis' habit of comparing words and phrases from one holy book to the next. Yet, experiencing the life of literature requires uninterrupted attention to narrative. Sports scores and weather maps can only detract from that experience.
